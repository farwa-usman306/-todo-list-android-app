# 📝 Simple To-Do List App

This is my **first Android project** developed using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.  
It’s a beginner-friendly to-do list app that supports core functionalities like:

- Adding new tasks
- Deleting tasks
- Undo delete action (Snackbar)
- Marking tasks as completed (line-through effect)
- Counters for total, completed, and remaining tasks

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks
- 🗑️ Delete tasks with undo option
- ✔️ Mark tasks as completed (with visual line-through)
- 📊 Counter for completed and remaining tasks

## ⚠️ Developer Note

To keep things simple as a beginner, I used **multiple individual lists** instead of creating a single `Task` class or data model.  
I understand that this makes the code **less clean and unprofessional**, but:

> ✨ This was a learning-first project, and I focused on **understanding UI behavior and state updates** more than perfect structure.

I plan to **refactor and improve code structure** in future projects using proper data models and architectural patterns like MVVM.
